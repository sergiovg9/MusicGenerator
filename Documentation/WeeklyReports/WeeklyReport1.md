# Weekly report 1

During this week, the project topic was selected, focusing on **music generation** through machine learning methods. The primary objective is to develop a system capable of learning musical structures from MIDI datasets and generating new melodies based on statistical models.

The project requirements specification was formally defined, including the problem statement, goals, algorithmic approach, and data sources. The design specifies the use of a Markov chain combined with a trie data structure to efficiently manage and generate musical sequences of arbitrary order.

The application environment was initialized, and a GitHub Actions workflow was configured to enable continuous integration, testing, and deployment.
