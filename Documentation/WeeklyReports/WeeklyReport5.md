# Weekly report 5

This week’s work focused primarily on the design and development of the user interface for the project. The goal was to establish a coherent and modular visual structure that will later support the integration of the Markov chain–based generation engine. Initial aesthetic and functional guidelines were also defined to facilitate future iterations.

Tests are currently being conducted with Tkinter and PyQt6, evaluating their strengths, limitations, and level of integration with the rest of the system. The objective is to determine which tool offers a more stable and flexible workflow, especially for handling graphics such as the staff, parameter selectors, and other interactive components.

Although significant progress has been made, the interface is still not ready. Work continues on aligning elements, interaction logic, graphical component stability, and fixing unexpected behaviors found during testing.
